# Vendor Performance Analysis 📊

## Project Overview
This project analyzes vendor performance to identify profitability, inventory efficiency, and sales trends.  
The goal is to support data-driven decisions related to pricing, vendor dependency, and inventory management.

## Business Objectives
- Identify underperforming brands requiring pricing or promotional changes
- Analyze top vendors contributing to sales and profit
- Study the impact of bulk purchasing on unit cost
- Evaluate inventory turnover and unsold stock
- Compare profit margins of high- and low-performing vendors

## Dataset
- `vendor_sales_summary.csv`
- Contains purchase cost, sales quantity, revenue, profit margin, freight cost, and inventory metrics

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- SciPy (for statistical testing)

## Key Analysis Performed
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Outlier and negative value handling
- Correlation analysis
- Vendor contribution analysis
- Inventory turnover analysis
- Hypothesis testing (Profit Margin comparison)

## Key Insights
- Top 10 vendors contribute ~66% of total purchases
- Bulk purchasing reduces unit cost by ~72%
- Some vendors maintain high margins but low sales volume
- Slow-moving inventory accounts for ~$2.7M in unsold capital
- Profit margins differ significantly between top and low-performing vendors
